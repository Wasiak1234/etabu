# eTABU Clone
eTABU is a social game in which two teams alternate guessing passwords transmitted by a player who cannot use forbidden words or gestures. The original game is only available for phones, so I wanted to take on this challenge and created a project that is playable on all devices!

## Technologies I've used:
Typescript + React + Redux

## What I'm planning to add:

    - Dynamic data (cards will not be repeated, the user will be able to add their own categories)
    - Add sound effects
    - Create components for each of start icons
    - Add animations and improve existed
    - Create a component that clearly explains the rules of the game
    - <del> Add ability to change interface language and cards </del>
    - Add more cards and categories
